# myWebsite2.0

The second version of my website built only 2 weeks after learning a basic HTML &amp; CSS course from Codecademy :D
I apologize if some of this code is sloppy! (I am posting this repo for the sole purpose of tracking my progress... and for when I get nostalgic in the future)

### (Note: There may be an improved version of my site uploaded by the time you read this... The evolution of perfection is to never stop creating!)
